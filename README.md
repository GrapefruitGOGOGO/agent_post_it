A smart home item management system with AI-powered chat interface, built with Vue 3 and TypeScript.

## ü§ñ AI Agent

This project features an intelligent AI agent that can help you manage your household items through natural language conversations. The agent is built using OpenAI's Function Calling technology and can:

- Understand natural language commands and questions
- Perform CRUD operations on items
- Provide smart suggestions and reminders
- Handle complex queries with multiple conditions
- Maintain context throughout the conversation
- Format responses in a user-friendly way

### Key Features of the AI Agent

1. **Natural Language Understanding**

   - Understands various ways of expressing the same intent
   - Handles complex queries with multiple conditions
   - Provides contextual responses

2. **Function Calling**

   - Seamlessly integrates with item management functions
   - Handles multiple operations in a single conversation
   - Maintains state between function calls

3. **Smart Features**

   - Expiration date tracking and reminders
   - Low stock alerts
   - Category-based organization
   - Price tracking and analysis

4. **User Experience**
   - Real-time streaming responses
   - Typing indicators
   - Markdown formatting support
   - Error handling and recovery

### Example Interactions

```
User: Add a new item - milk, 2 bottles, price 5.99, expiry date next month
Agent: I'll help you add the milk to your inventory...

User: What items are expiring soon?
Agent: Let me check your inventory for items nearing expiration...

User: Where is my laptop?
Agent: Let me search for your laptop in the inventory...
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning

This project currently uses OpenAI API directly in the frontend, which is **not recommended for production use**. The API key is exposed in the frontend code, which could lead to:

- Unauthorized usage of your API key
- Potential financial charges from API abuse
- Security vulnerabilities

For production use, we strongly recommend:

1. Deploying a backend service to handle API calls
2. Moving the API key to environment variables on the server
3. Implementing proper authentication and rate limiting
4. Using API key rotation and monitoring

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for more details.
